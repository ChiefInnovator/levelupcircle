# Level-Up Circle Generator

Interactive single-page tool for designing and exporting a "Level-Up Circle" ‚Äî a visual map of interconnected goals or initiatives. Built as a self‚Äëcontained HTML Canvas app (`levelup-circle-generator.html`) with no external dependencies.

## Features
- Up to 36 labeled points arranged radially
- Smart color generation (equal or golden-angle spacing) for vivid, distinct colors
- Independent glow effects for points/labels and lines/circle
- Automatic multi-line smart label wrapping
- Adjustable point size & label offset spacing
- Complete connection mesh toggle (show/hide)
- High‚Äëresolution PNG export (1080, 2048, 3840 square)
- Local state save/restore via `localStorage`
- Responsive resizing with `ResizeObserver`

## Quick Start
1. Open `levelup-circle-generator.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Safari, Firefox). No build step.
2. Adjust the controls in the left panel.
3. Click Export PNG to download a high‚Äëresolution image.

## Core Controls
| Control | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Title | Text at top (glow optional) |
| Number of Points | 1‚Äì36 nodes around the circle |
| Export Size | Output canvas dimension (square) |
| Point Size | Radius of each goal node |
| Label Spacing | Distance of label boxes from point edge |
| Neon Glow Points & Labels | Toggle glow for points + text |
| Neon Glow Circle & Lines | Toggle glow for ring + connections |
| Show Connection Lines | Toggle full interconnection mesh |
| üé® Random Colors | Re‚Äëgenerate colors (alternates spacing mode) |
| üìã Load Example | Reset to seeded demo state |
| üíæ Save State | Persist current configuration to `localStorage` |
| üóëÔ∏è Clear State | Clear saved state and reload example |
| üì∏ Export PNG | Generate and download image |

## Color Algorithm
Colors are generated in HSL space:
- Start hue: random or seeded
- Spacing mode: `equal` (360/N) or `golden` (‚âà137.507¬∞)
- High saturation (‚âà0.85‚Äì0.90) & balanced lightness (0.50) for vibrancy
- Adjacent duplicate prevention with hue nudging

## Label Wrapping
Custom smart wrapping tries semantic split points (connector words, balanced halves) before falling back to a traditional width-based wrapper. Ensures readable two-line labels without overflowing the radial layout.

## Export Notes
- Export uses an off-screen canvas at target resolution
- Glow and stroke effects scale proportionally
- Filenames: `level-up-circle-<size>x<size>.png`

## State Persistence
Configuration object is serialized to `localStorage` under key `levelUpCircleState`. Backward compatibility logic normalizes older glow property names.

level_up_circle_blog.md        # Long-form article explaining the concept

```

## Concept Article
See `level_up_circle_blog.md` for the philosophy behind interconnected goal design ("Level-Up Circle" / synergy mapping / flywheel thinking).

## Roadmap Ideas
- Drag-and-drop manual reordering or angular offset per point
- Selective connection modes (adjacent, strategic, custom)
- Import/export JSON configuration files
- Dark/light theme toggle
- SVG export for print / vector workflows
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation & reduced motion mode
